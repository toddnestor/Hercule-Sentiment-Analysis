Hercules Sentiment Analysis adds columns to the comments and posts tables that show the sentiment of the comment, post title, and post content.

== Description ==

**UPDATE**
Now you can set an option in the new settings page (titled "Herc Sentiment" in the admin bar) to auto-approve positive comments, or un-approve negative comments.

Hercules Sentiment Analysis uses PHP Insight (https://github.com/JWHennessey/phpInsight) to determine whether comments, posts, and post titles
are positive, negative, or neutral.  This will help bloggers respond to readers who have concerns faster (or delete negative comments if necessary),
as well as know what sentiment they are portraying with their post titles and content.

== Installation ==

Add this plugin by uploading the zip using the "Add Plugin" feature built into Wordpress.  Otherwise manaully unzip the folder
and upload the entire directory to your blog's plugins folder ( /wp-content/plugins/ ).  Next you have to activate the plugin.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
